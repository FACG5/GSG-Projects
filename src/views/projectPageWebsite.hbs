  <p class="description">The Code Academy is Palestineâ€™s first full-stack coding bootcamp with a flagship campus in Gaza and second campus opening
    in the West Bank in November 2018. The Code Academy is a joint project of Mercy Corps/Gaza Sky Geeks and Founders & Coders
    International. We train 16 students per cohort in a full-time, intensive course for 8 weeks with an additional 16 weeks
    of project-based learning with real-world clients to jumpstart your professional portfolio. The objective is to graduate
    as full-stack developers who can deploy production-grade software online and secure high-quality jobs with companies
    or work as freelance developers.</p>
